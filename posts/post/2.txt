a:T1c0a,<h1>Markdown Quick Reference</h1>
<p>This guide is a very brief overview, with examples, of the syntax that <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> supports. It is itself written in Markdown and you can copy the samples over to the left-hand pane for experimentation. It&#39;s shown as <em>text</em> and not <em>rendered HTML</em>.</p>
<h1>Simple Text Formatting</h1>
<p>First thing is first. You can use <em>stars</em> or <em>underscores</em> for italics. <strong>Double stars</strong> and <strong>double underscores</strong> for bold. <em><strong>Three together</strong></em> for <em><strong>both</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Paragraphs are pretty easy too. Just have a blank line between chunks of text.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This chunk of text is in a block quote. Its multiple lines will all be
indented a bit from the rest of the text.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Multiple levels of block quotes also work.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes you want to include code, such as when you are explaining how <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> HTML tags work, or maybe you are a programmer and you are discussing <code>someMethod()</code>.</p>
<p>If you want to include code and have new
lines preserved, indent the line with a tab
or at least four spaces:</p>
<pre><code>Extra spaces work here too.
This is also called preformatted text and it is useful for showing examples.
The text will stay as text, so any *markdown* or &lt;u&gt;HTML&lt;/u&gt; you add will
not show up formatted. This way you can show markdown examples in a
markdown document.
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>You can also use preformatted text with your blockquotes
as long as you add at least five spaces.
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<h1>Headings</h1>
<p>There are a couple of ways to make headings. Using three or more equals signs on a line under a heading makes it into an &#39;h1&#39; style. Three or more hyphens under a line makes it &#39;h2&#39; (slightly smaller). You can also use multiple pound symbols (<code>#</code>) before and after a heading. Pounds after the title are ignored. Here are some examples:</p>
<h1>This is H1</h1>
<h2>This is H2</h2>
<h1>This is H1</h1>
<h2>This is H2</h2>
<h3>This is H3 with some extra pounds</h3>
<h4>You get the idea</h4>
<h5>I don&#39;t need extra pounds at the end</h5>
<h6>H6 is the max</h6>
<h1>Links</h1>
<p>Let&#39;s link to a few sites. First, let&#39;s use the bare URL, like <a href="https://www.github.com">https://www.github.com</a>. Great for text, but ugly for HTML.
Next is an inline link to <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>. A little nicer.
This is a reference-style link to [Wikipedia] <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org">1</a>.
Lastly, here&#39;s a pretty link to <a href="https://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo</a>. The reference-style and pretty links both automatically use the links defined below, but they could be defined <em>anywhere</em> in the markdown and are removed from the HTML. The names are also case insensitive, so you can use <a href="https://www.yahoo.com">YaHoO</a> and have it link properly.</p>
<p>Title attributes may be added to links by adding text after a link.
This is the <a href="https://www.bing.com" title="Bing">inline link</a> with a &#39;Bing&#39; title.
You can also go to [W3C] [2] and maybe visit a [friend].
[2]: <a href="https://w3c.org">https://w3c.org</a> (The W3C puts out specs for web-based things)
[Friend]: <a href="https://facebook.com">https://facebook.com</a> &#39;Facebook!&#39;</p>
<p>Email addresses in plain text are not linked: <a href="mailto:test@example.com">test@example.com</a>.
Email addresses wrapped in angle brackets are linked: <a href="mailto:test@example.com">test@example.com</a>.
They are also obfuscated so that email harvesting spam robots hopefully won&#39;t get them.</p>
<h1>Lists</h1>
<ul>
<li>This is a bulleted list</li>
<li>Great for shopping lists</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You can also use hyphens</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Or plus symbols</li>
</ul>
<p>The above is an &#39;unordered&#39; list. Now, on for a bit of order.</p>
<ol>
<li>Numbered lists are also easy</li>
<li>Just start with a number</li>
<li>However, the actual number doesn&#39;t matter when converted to HTML.</li>
<li>This will still show up as 4.</li>
</ol>
<p>You might want a few advanced lists:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This top-level list is wrapped in paragraph tags</p>
</li>
<li><p>This generates an extra space between each top-level item.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You do it by adding a blank line</p>
</li>
<li><p>This nested list also has blank lines between the list items.</p>
</li>
<li><p>How to create nested lists</p>
<ol>
<li>Start your regular list</li>
<li>Indent nested lists with two spaces</li>
<li>Further nesting means you should indent with two more spaces</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>This line is indented with four spaces.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>List items can be quite lengthy. You can keep typing and either continue
them on the next line with no indentation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Alternately, if that looks ugly, you can also
indent the next line a bit for a prettier look.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can put large blocks of text in your list by just indenting with two spaces.</p>
<p>This is formatted the same as code, but you can inspect the HTML</p>
<p>and find that it&#39;s just wrapped in a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag and <em>won&#39;t</em> be shown</p>
<p>as preformatted text.</p>
<p>You can keep adding more and more paragraphs to a single
list item by adding the traditional blank line and then keep
on indenting the paragraphs with two spaces.</p>
<p>You really only need to indent the first line,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>but that looks ugly.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Lists support blockquotes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just like this example here. By the way, you can
nest lists inside blockquotes!</p>
<ul>
<li>Fantastic!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Lists support preformatted text</p>
<pre><code>You just need to indent an additional four spaces.
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Even More</h1>
<h2>Horizontal Rule</h2>
<p>If you need a horizontal rule you just need to put at least three hyphens, asterisks, or underscores on a line by themselves. You can also even put spaces between the characters.</p>
<hr>
<hr>
<hr>
<p>Those three all produced horizontal lines. Keep in mind that three hyphens under any text turns that text into a heading, so add a blank like if you use hyphens.</p>
<h2>Images</h2>
<p>Images work exactly like links, but they have exclamation points in front. They work with references and titles too.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.google.com/images/errors/logo_sm.gif" alt="Google Logo"> and <img src="/images/posts/gambar1.png" alt="Happy" title="contoh gambar">.</p>
<h2>Inline HTML</h2>
<p>If markdown is too limiting, you can just insert your own <strike>crazy</strike> HTML. Span-level HTML <u>can <em>still</em> use markdown</u>. Block level elements must be separated from text by a blank line and must not have any spaces before the opening and closing HTML.</p>
<div style='font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', 'Comic Sans', cursive;'>
It is a pity, but markdown does **not** work in here for most markdown parsers.
[Marked] handles it pretty well.
